 ------------TO DO LIST--------------:

 --- Revise the boundary conditions for electric potential:

 --- Check mappedContinuity(Solid/Fluid) is written correctly:

 	- Check signage!!!

 --- Include electrostatic forces within mappedContinuity of concentrations

 	- May be able to ngelect, if no charge accumulation on boundary & temperature continuity
